## Overview
This project detects and tracks red objects in real-time from a camera feed. It processes each frame, identifying red regions and tracking their movement using OpenCV.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Identifies red objects in each frame of the video.
- **Tracking Mechanism**: Follows the movement of red objects over time.
- **OpenCV-Based**: Utilizes OpenCV for efficient image processing.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows adjusting sensitivity for better accuracy.
